Far-away, the cosmic microwave background is observed at a redshift of $z \sim 1100$ (image credit: WMAP). The Epoch of Reionization represents a mostly unexplored era between the two, and can be probed by measuring red-shifted $21$\tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em}cm radiation from neutral hydrogen.}}{5}{figure.1.2}
